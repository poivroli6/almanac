# Top Button Column Distribution Fix

## âœ… Fixed Column Distribution Issue

The "top" button was creating an uneven column distribution where:
- **Column 1**: Got 5 sections (too many)
- **Column 2**: Got only 2 sections (too few) 
- **Column 3**: Got all remaining sections (unbalanced)

## ðŸ”§ Solution Implemented

Updated the `create_topbar_content()` function in `almanac/pages/profile.py` to:

1. **Count total sections dynamically** instead of hardcoded ranges
2. **Distribute sections evenly** across all 3 columns
3. **Handle remainder sections** properly when total doesn't divide evenly by 3

### Before (Uneven Distribution):
```python
col1_items = sidebar_sections[0:5]   # 5 sections
col2_items = sidebar_sections[5:7]  # Only 2 sections!
col3_items = sidebar_sections[7:]   # All remaining sections
```

### After (Even Distribution):
```python
# Calculate even distribution
total_sections = len(sidebar_sections)
sections_per_column = total_sections // 3
remainder = total_sections % 3

# Distribute evenly with remainder handling
col1_end = sections_per_column + (1 if remainder > 0 else 0)
col1_items = sidebar_sections[0:col1_end]

col2_start = col1_end
col2_end = col2_start + sections_per_column + (1 if remainder > 1 else 0)
col2_items = sidebar_sections[col2_start:col2_end]

col3_items = sidebar_sections[col2_end:]
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

With approximately 13 sections total, the new distribution will be:
- **Column 1**: ~4-5 sections (Basic controls: Product, Time, Date Range, Filters)
- **Column 2**: ~4-5 sections (Scenarios and Comparisons: Active Scenarios, Price/Volume Comparison)
- **Column 3**: ~4-5 sections (Advanced features: Export, Summary, etc.)

## âœ… Benefits

1. **Balanced Layout**: All 3 columns now have similar content length
2. **Better Organization**: Related sections stay together
3. **Dynamic Distribution**: Automatically adjusts if sections are added/removed
4. **Improved UX**: More visually balanced and easier to scan

The "top" button should now create a much more balanced 3-column layout with evenly distributed content across all columns.
