# Economic Events Filter Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented economic event filters in the Almanac Futures application, allowing users to analyze market behavior on days with major economic data releases.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Module: `economic_events.py`
**Location**: `almanac/data_sources/economic_events.py`

**Features**:
- Economic calendar data for 2023-2025
- 7 major economic event types:
  - CPI (Consumer Price Index)
  - FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)
  - NFP (Non-Farm Payrolls)
  - PPI (Producer Price Index)
  - Retail Sales
  - GDP (Gross Domestic Product)
  - PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures)
- 224 total economic event dates
- Helper functions for date checking and event retrieval

**Key Functions**:
```python
is_economic_event_date(date, event_type)  # Check if date has event
get_economic_event_dates(event_type)      # Get all dates for event type
get_all_major_event_dates()               # Get all event dates
get_events_on_date(date)                  # Get events on specific date
```

### 2. Updated: `filters.py`
**Location**: `almanac/features/filters.py`

**Changes**:
- Added import for `is_economic_event_date`
- Extended `apply_filters()` to support 8 new filter types:

  - `retail_sales_day`: Filter for Retail Sales days
  - `gdp_day`: Filter for GDP days
  - `pce_day`: Filter for PCE days
  - `major_event_day`: Filter for any major event day

**Implementation**:
- Economic event filters applied after weekday filters
- Efficient date-based filtering using lambda functions
- Compatible with existing filter logic (AND/OR operators)

### 3. Updated: `profile.py`
**Location**: `almanac/pages/profile.py`

**Changes**:
- Added 8 new filter options to UI with appropriate icons:
  - 💰 CPI Release Day

- NFP date validation ✓
- String date input handling ✓
- Major event aggregation ✓
- Multiple events on same date ✓
- Data coverage across years ✓

**Results**: All tests passed successfully

### 5. Documentation: `ECONOMIC_EVENTS_README.md`
**Location**: `ECONOMIC_EVENTS_README.md`

**Contents**:
- Complete feature documentation
- Usage examples for each filter type
- Use case scenarios
- Technical details and API reference
- Maintenance guide
- Future enhancement suggestions

## Data Quality

### Event Distribution
- **CPI**: 36 dates (12 per year for 2023-2025)
- **FOMC**: 24 dates (8 per year)
- **NFP**: 36 dates (12 per year)
- **PPI**: 36 dates (12 per year)
- **Retail Sales**: 36 dates (12 per year)
- **GDP**: 36 dates (12 per year, quarterly × 3 releases)
- **PCE**: 36 dates (12 per year)
- **Total**: 224 unique event dates

### Multi-Event Days
16 dates have multiple events occurring simultaneously, such as:
- 2024-06-12: CPI + FOMC
- 2024-05-15: CPI + Retail Sales
- 2023-12-13: FOMC + PPI

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Analyze FOMC Days
```
1. Select Product: ES (S&P 500)
2. Check Filter: "🏦 FOMC Meeting Day"
3. View Results: See intraday patterns on Fed decision days
```

### Example 2: High-Impact Days + Bullish Previous Day
```
1. Select Product: GC (Gold)
2. Check Filters:
   - "💰 CPI Release Day"
   - "📈 Prev-Day: Close > Open (Bullish)"
3. Logic Operator: AND
4. View Results: Gold behavior on CPI days following bullish days
```

### Example 3: All Economic Events
```
1. Select Product: NQ (Nasdaq)
2. Check Filter: "⚡ Any Major Economic Event"
3. Date Range: 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31
4. View Results: Tech index behavior across all major events
```

## Integration Points

The new filters integrate seamlessly with existing features:
- ✓ Works with other conditional filters
- ✓ Compatible with AND/OR logic operators
- ✓ Supports date range selection
- ✓ Works with all products
- ✓ Exports to CSV/PNG with filter info
- ✓ Shareable URLs include event filters
- ✓ Preset system can save event filter configurations

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Filtering**: Date lookups use set-based containment checks (O(1))
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal - ~224 date strings in memory
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more event types or dates
- **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained module with hardcoded dates

## Future Enhancements

Suggested improvements for future versions:
1. **API Integration**: Connect to economic calendar APIs for auto-updates
2. **International Events**: Add ECB, BOJ, BOE decisions
3. **More Events**: ISM PMI, Housing Data, Consumer Confidence
4. **Event Importance**: Add high/medium/low impact levels
5. **Release Times**: Include exact release times (8:30 AM ET typical)
6. **Historical Impact**: Pre-compute typical volatility for each event
7. **Event Annotations**: Show event markers on charts
8. **Countdown Timer**: Show time until next major event

## Maintenance

### Adding New Dates
To update the calendar for future years:
1. Edit `almanac/data_sources/economic_events.py`
2. Add dates to appropriate event type set
3. Use format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
4. Run `test_economic_events.py` to verify
5. Update documentation if needed
