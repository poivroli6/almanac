## Technical Details

### Files Modified/Created
1. **`almanac/data_sources/economic_events.py`** - New module with economic calendar data
2. **`almanac/features/filters.py`** - Updated to handle economic event filters
3. **`almanac/pages/profile.py`** - UI updated with new filter options

### Data Structure
Economic events are stored as sets of date strings in `YYYY-MM-DD` format:
```python
ECONOMIC_EVENTS = {
    'CPI': {'2024-01-11', '2024-02-13', ...},
    'FOMC': {'2024-01-31', '2024-03-20', ...},
    # etc.
}
```

## Maintenance Notes

### Updating Economic Calendars
To add new dates or years, edit `almanac/data_sources/economic_events.py`:

```python
ECONOMIC_EVENTS = {
    'CPI': {
        # Add new dates in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
        '2026-01-14',
        '2026-02-11',
        # etc.
    }
}
```

### Data Sources
Economic event dates should be sourced from:
- Federal Reserve official calendar (FOMC)
- Bureau of Labor Statistics schedule (CPI, PPI, NFP)
- Bureau of Economic Analysis schedule (GDP, PCE)
- Census Bureau schedule (Retail Sales)

### Future Enhancements
Potential improvements:
1. **API Integration**: Connect to real-time economic calendar APIs
2. **Event Importance**: Add weight/importance levels to events
3. **Release Time**: Include exact release times (typically 8:30 AM ET)
4. **Historical Impact**: Store typical volatility metrics for each event
5. **International Events**: Add ECB, BOJ, BOE decisions
6. **More Events**: Add ISM PMI, Housing Data, Consumer Confidence, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Returned
- Check if the selected date range includes economic event dates
- Verify the product has data for those specific dates
- Use "Any Major Economic Event" to test if any events match

### Unexpected Results
- Economic calendars can change - releases can be rescheduled
- Some events have multiple releases per period (GDP: advance, preliminary, final)
- Check that the correct event type is selected

## API Reference

### Function: `is_economic_event_date()`
```python
from almanac.data_sources.economic_events import is_economic_event_date

# Check if a date is a CPI release day
is_cpi = is_economic_event_date('2024-01-11', 'CPI')  # Returns True
```

### Function: `get_events_on_date()`
```python
from almanac.data_sources.economic_events import get_events_on_date

# Get all events on a specific date
events = get_events_on_date('2024-01-31')  # Returns ['FOMC']
